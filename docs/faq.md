## What is the fluct property in application's package.json?
In addition to typical information about npm,
fluct adds some fluct-specific metadata in `fluct` property such as `accountId`, `restapiId` and `roleName`.

The `accountId` is integers in user's ARN. It is used to compose ARNs of your AWS Lambda functions and the role attached to them. You need to manually configure it.

The `restapiId` is used to detect which Restapi is associated to the application. It is automatically set when you invoke `fluct deploy` at the 1st time.

The `roleName` is the name of the role that is attached to your AWS Lambda functions to allow them to be invoked from Amazon API Gateway. You need to manually prepare and configure it.

```json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "private": true,
  "fluct": {
    "accountId": "012345678912",
    "restapiId": "b15rph8lh3",
    "roleName": "fluct-example-role"
  }
}
```

## How to prepare roleName?
Head over to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and create a new IAM role
that has `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`, then copy its name and paste it into package.json.
If you have installed aws-cli and you have a permission to create a new IAM role,
you can also create it by the following command (where `fluct-myapp` is the new role name):

```
$ aws iam create-role --role-name fluct-myapp --assume-role-policy-document arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
```

## How to configure AWS credentials?
Fluct will automatically detect your AWS credentials from the shared credentials file in
`~/.aws/credentials` or environment variables such as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
and `AWS_PROFILE`. Fluct internally uses AWS SDK for JavaScript, so please see
[Configuring the SDK in Node.js â€” AWS SDK for JavaScript](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html)
for more details about AWS credentials settings.

## How to change an action's method/path/content-type?
Open your action's package.json and edit properties of `fluct` property like this:

```json
{
  "name": "list_users",
  "private": true,
  "fluct": {
    "contentType": "text/html",
    "httpMethod": "GET",
    "path": "/users",
    "statusCode": 200
  }
}
```

## How to change an action's behavior?
Open your action's index.js and edit export.handler function.
The 1st argument of `context.succeed` will be the endpoint's response body.

```js
export.handler = function (event, context) {
  context.succeed('Hello, world!');
};
```

## How to access to HTTP request data?
The `event` object provides some information about current HTTP request.
This is an event object example:

```js
{
  accountId: "",
  apiId: "os92ef4zmf",
  apiKey: "",
  caller: "",
  headerParams: {
    Accept: "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8",
    Accept-Encoding: "gzip",
    Accept-Language: "ja,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6",

    X-Forwarded-Port: "443",
    X-Forwarded-Proto: "https"
  },
  httpMethod: "GET",
  pathParams: { },
  queryParams: {
    foo: "bar"
  },
  requestId: "c2cee057-41e2-11e5-81c7-e9b9b0c6b555",
  resourceId: "2x33sn",
  resourcePath: "/echo",
  responseBody: { },
  sourceIp: "218.42.217.86",
  stage: "production",
  user: "",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/44.0.2403.130 Safari/537.36",
  userArn: ""
}
```

## How to use node-config for fluct?
node-config the npm module is integrated.
If you want, please make `config` directory in your fluct root.
Fluct will include the directory into `lambda.zip` on compile.

## Is there a demo application using fluct?
I'm very pleased that you asked that! See https://github.com/r7kamura/fluct-example
